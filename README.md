This Python code uses an inner class to securely handle sensitive data for an AWS EC2 instance. The outer class Ec2 manages instance details, while the inner class Sensitive_data stores private attributes like Ami and Key_Pair. Sensitive data is accessed only through specific methods in the outer class, ensuring proper security and data encapsulation.
